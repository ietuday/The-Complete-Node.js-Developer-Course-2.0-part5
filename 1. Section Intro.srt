Hello and welcome to Section 8 security and authentication in this section we're going to be continuing

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,600
on with the to do API turning it into a more real world application by adding user accounts.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,050
Up until now anybody could come in and manage to do is created by anybody else I could go in and wipe

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,850
everyone's data.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,590
And there's nothing they could do about it.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,760
Once we add user accounts we're going to be locking down that data.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,430
You're only going to be able to do anything with the news when you're logged in.

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,390
You only see to news you create it and you can only update the dues that you created.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,670
Now in order to do all this we are going to look at some advanced Mongo DB and Mongoose topics and we're

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:43,370
also going to look at some security topics like hashing encryption and Jason Webb tokens all of this

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,740
is coming up in this section.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,280
But let's get started by creating our user model
